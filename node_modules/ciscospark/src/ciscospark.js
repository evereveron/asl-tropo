/**
 * SDK for Cisco Spark
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * ```javascript
 * npm install --save ciscospark
 * ```
 *
 * ## A Note on Browsers
 * Ciscospark is fully browser compatible but we don't distribute a browserified
 * bundle at this time; you'll need to build the bundle yourself. We use
 * [browserify](http://browserify.org/) internally and
 * [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) should work as well.
 *
 * ## Getting Started
 *
 * > The examples below have both ES5 and ES6 variations. The ES6 examples will
 * > require you to build your project using [babel](https://babeljs.io). The
 * > ES5 examples should be directly runnable.
 *
 * The quickest way to get started is to set your access token as an environment
 * variable:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <%= gettingstarted__accesstoken_es6 %>
 * ```
 * ```javascript
 * <%= gettingstarted__accesstoken %>
 * ```

 * ### Refresh Tokens
 *
 * For long-running use cases, you'll need to provide a refresh token, client
 * id, and client secret:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <%= gettingstarted__oauth__refreshtokens_es6 %>
 * ```
 *
 * ## Runtime Configuration
 *
 * While environment variables are handy for development, they don't really help
 * you write an app for lots of users. You can pass credentials to the spark
 * using init.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <%= gettingstarted__runtimeconfiguration__init_es6 %>
 * ```
 *
 * ## OAuth
 *
 * OAuth is baked right into spark so you don't need to figure it out.
 *
 * To kick off an OAuth login, simply call `spark.authenticate()` which will
 * direct the current app to our login page.
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <%= gettingstarted__oauth__authenticate_es6 %>
 * ```
 *
 * To refresh an access token, call `spark.authorize()`. (Note: this should
 * generally happen for you automatically).
 *
 * ```javascript
 * <%= gettingstarted__oauth__authorize_es6 %>
 * ```
 *
 * @class CiscoSpark
 * @extends SparkCore
